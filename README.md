MAXWELL (Microscopy by Achromatic X-rays With Emission of Laminar Light) is a tandem use X-ray/visible light microscopy technique designed and implemented at BL29XU at the RIKEN SPring-8 Center, Japan. This repository contains several scripts, primarily in Python and Java, which are intended to be used for experimentation and analysis on output from the MAXWELL microscopy system.
